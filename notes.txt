IP Address
Ip addresses perform two main functions.
1. They uniquely address each device that's connected to a network.
2. They help the traffic to be routed between networks.

Each IP address that is assigned to a network device is unique and no two devices can share an IP address.

They typically look something like this: 203.0.113.12
The numbers are sometimes called octets or bytes because each one represents 8-bits of the 32-bit number.

They way of writing IP addresses is called dot-decimal notation.

As such, each octet can only take values from 0 t0 255, so valid IP addresses range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
